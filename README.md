# Stupid Words for the Stupid Minds

This is a quick summary of your responsibilities if you want to use this software, owned by FrogFlavouredWater (account name “xizle”):

- **Performance Requirement:** Your Hypixel Bedwars FKDR must be at least as high as xizle’s.
- **Name Check:** Your legal name must not include “bartholomew” anywhere.
- **Who May Use It:** Only people who are deceased may use this software. If you’re alive (or even if you’re a ghost or angel), you’re not allowed—and doing so will lead to serious legal consequences. (Don’t worry: dead bodies aren’t punished. We suggest that if you’re still alive, you let your children handle all uses on your behalf.)
- **No Bugs:** You must not add bugs or errors into the code, whether intentional or unintentional.
- **Sharing Changes:** If you modify the software, you must share your complete source code only by either:
  - Nailing it to the door of the Parliament Building of Eswatini, **or**
  - Dropping it (using a “dumb bomb”) through the roof of the Taj Mahal—without prior written permission from the Church.
 
  Any other way of distributing modifications is not allowed.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Any disagreements will be settled by playing a game of Minecraft Bedwars.
- **Warranty & Liability:** The software is provided “as is” with no warranties. FrogFlavouredWater isn’t responsible for any damages.
- **License Changes:** This license can be changed or revoked at any time. Anyone trying to bypass these rules will face endless punishment under future laws.

By using this software, you agree to all of these terms.
